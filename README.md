# Influencer Selection — Praducci Campaign (E-commerce Networks)

This project implements an influencer selection algorithm for maximizing brand awareness in a social network.  
It was developed as part of the **E-commerce in Networks** course (096211) at Technion.

## Problem Setup
- Social network: *NoseBook* (graph of users and friendships)  
- Budget: $1000 for influencer recruitment  
- Each influencer demands a cost (from `costs.csv`)  
- Diffusion process: stochastic, modeled by `Praducci_simulation.py`  
- Horizon: 6 rounds of exposure  
- Objective: maximize expected number of users aware of the brand (*Praducci*)  

## Approach
- Built the graph using **NetworkX**  
- Partitioned the network into communities using **greedy modularity clustering**  
- Selected representative influencers from each cluster based on:
  - **Degree centrality** (connectivity)  
  - **Betweenness centrality** (bridges between clusters)  
- Generated combinations of candidate sets under budget  
- Evaluated each set using repeated simulations (10 rounds per set)  
- Chose the influencer group with the highest average exposure score  

## Deliverables
- `213932338_214034621.py` — solution code  
- `213932338_214034621.pdf` — written explanation of the method  
- `influencers_submission.csv` — chosen influencer set for simulation (generated by the code)  

## Tools
- Python 3.10  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `networkx`, `random`, `csv`  

## How to Run
```bash
python 213932338_214034621.py
